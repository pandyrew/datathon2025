From last year’s Datathon, I learned how to extract meaningful insights from large datasets and translate them into actionable recommendations, a skill that aligns with my responsibilities as a current TPM at First American.

As a freshman last year, my biggest goal was to get involved in everything, take risks, and explore different opportunities to find what I enjoyed. The Datathon was one of the first events that allowed me to do this, as it introduced me to DS in a fast-paced and hands-on environment where I was able to collaborate with others to solve real-world problems. That experience, along with competing at Zothacks, LA Hacks, and VenusHacks, made me realize how much I enjoyed the hacker community. My passion for this community grew so much that I became a Corporate Outreach Director at Hack at UCI, where I’ve had the opportunity to organize three large-scale hackathons. Through this experience, I’ve developed an appreciation for the work that goes into making these events successful and understanding what goes on behind the scenes has only made me more excited to compete again this year.

During my interviews, I was often asked about data-driven decision-making, and I consistently referenced my Datathon project analyzing Airbnb’s market in Dublin. I explained how my team and I processed over 43,000+ entries, visualized key market trends using Python libraries, and trained a Random Forest Classifier that achieved 89.35% accuracy. I highlighted how we leveraged these insights to propose pricing strategies and location-based recommendations, demonstrating the real-world impact of our findings. By walking interviewers through our analytical approach, I was able to showcase not just my technical expertise but also my ability to make informed decisions. Now with a deeper understanding of statistics and machine learning, I’m even more excited for this year’s Datathon as I have another opportunity to do it all over again.

Even before college, I was fascinated by data, but now, I recognize it as a true passion. In just my second year, I have gained extensive experience with data tools such as SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Python through various opportunities— including attending last year’s datathon, participating in Data@UCI meetings, working as a data analyst intern at DevMatch, and conducting research at the AiDA (AI & Data Analytics) Lab at UC San Diego.

My experiences at DevMatch and AiDA have shown me the power of data storytelling, whether for business insights or evaluating machine learning models. At AiDA, I was particularly surprised by how much I learned about crafting a compelling narrative. Preparing presentations at the start and end of the summer forced me to refine how I communicate complex data science concepts to different audiences. These skills will be invaluable as I compete in Soar into Data, my second datathon.

This time, I want to go beyond just delivering results— I want to make them resonate. Having experienced the fast-paced, high-impact environment of a datathon before, I know how important it is to balance technical execution with clear, persuasive storytelling. Soar into Data is more than a competition; it’s an opportunity to challenge myself, refine my voice, and take my data science communication to the next level.","https://github.com/Allison-Yeh","https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-yeh1/",true,"","2025-03-28T21:00:00.605","2025-03-28T23:01:07.158",""

Johnny Huu Do 	johnnyhd@uci.edu","","Participating in this Datathon represents a unique opportunity for me to bridge my interest in law with the evolving world of data science. As legal systems increasingly interact with technology—whether through predictive policing, algorithmic decision-making, or data-driven policy reforms—the ability to interpret and analyze data is becoming a critical skill for modern legal professionals.

Through this Datathon, I hope to gain practical experience in handling complex datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting findings that could support or challenge existing legal assumptions. This experience will not only strengthen my technical skill set but also enable me to better understand how data can be used responsibly and ethically within legal frameworks. I’m particularly interested in exploring topics such as fairness in algorithms, legal compliance in data handling, and how quantitative analysis can be used to inform equitable policy-making.

Ultimately, I see this Datathon as a stepping stone toward a career at the intersection of law and data—whether in legal tech, regulatory analytics, or public interest advocacy—where I can contribute to more transparent, data-informed legal systems.

I hope that participating in the Datathon will introduce me to these concepts and act as a bridge between my statistics knowledge and software engineering skills. By participating in the Datathon, I will be able to learn firsthand the process and benefits of machine learning. 
On top of my professional and academic development, I also look forward to the networking possibilities the Datathon will provide. I am excited to meet and collaborate with new people during the event and for the opportunity to meet potential employers, coworkers, and sponsors.

It was the first time I applied my statistical knowledge to something meaningful outside of class, and I was excited to share my findings with my journalism class. The results helped us identify underrepresented communities and guided us in achieving more equitable coverage.
Taking ICS classes has introduced me to Python and libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data analysis.

Right now, I’m focused on completing my lower-division courses, but Soar into Data feels like the perfect opportunity to finally take a real step toward the field I’m passionate about.

I’ve often wondered how much of what we learn in lectures actually applies to real-world problems. That’s why I’m excited about this Datathon — it’s a chance to move beyond theory and apply my skills to real challenges. I’m looking forward to working with unique datasets, uncovering hidden patterns, and solving problems — all of which remind me why I chose Computer Science in the first place: my love for problem-solving and discovering things that others might miss.

I’m especially excited about the mentorship aspect. Learning directly from industry professionals would give me a better understanding of what data science looks like outside of the classroom and help me grow both technically and professionally.
