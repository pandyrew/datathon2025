Many of these involve working with data, for example with Dr. Krone-Martins the project involves 3D astronomical data which we manipulated either by rotating by 1 pixel along an axis to augment the data or compressing to a latent representation for downstream ML tasks. For Professor Ahmed it involved looking at satellite data and working with geopandas and xarray libraries. I also worked with NLP for the Columbia research, including embedding string data in a vector database for similarity searches and making LLM synthetic data pipelines. I also like helping people, I am signed up as a tutor for COMPSCI 178, the machine learning class next quarter and would love to also gain experience helping people in data-related inquiries. ","I would advise people on data manipulation, potential data sources, and how to integrate AI/ML into their project if (I'd imagine many people would want to use AI in their projects). I'd be mainly assisting with python code. I put R because some of the code I work with in the astronomy research with Dr. Krone-Martins uses R, and I also used it in STATS-67, but I'm definitely less comfortable on R than python data libraries.
